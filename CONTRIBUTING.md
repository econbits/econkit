# Open Source, not Open Contribution

Econkit is Open Source, meaning that you can make a copy, modify it and use it as needed as long as you comply with the licensing terms (AGPL).

I am a solo developer and I am working on econkit as I find worrying the lack of Open Source tools to manage my financial life. I do this for fun but unfortunately have very little time in the week. To get the most out of my time, I will limit contributions to this project in the sense that I won't be merging pull requests. It is just ore work than I can currently handle.

On the other hand, feature requests and bug reports are strongly appreciated!
